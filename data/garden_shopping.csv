2025-09-07,Best spray day,,,,Tuesday evening looks calm/dry — plan Dipel or eco-oil
2025-09-07,AM Reminder,,,,"Cucumber (Lebanese): soil 19 °C — direct sow anytime now (germ 5–7 days). Sensitive to transplant shock, so sow straight in bed."
2025-09-08,AM/PM/Weekly block,,,,"AM (7:00): • Weather & soil: read today’s highs/lows and wind; measure soil temp at 10 cm and moisture at 7–10 cm. Water only if 7–10 cm is dry; spot-water carrots/beets if borderline. • Best spray day this week: call out the calm, dry, mild evening from the 7-day forecast for eco-oil on citrus or Dipel/Eco-Neem (avoid hot/windy days). • Seedlings: – Roma tomatoes: legginess/light check daily (light 2–3 cm above canopy; rotate; gentle airflow; 18–24°C; vent dome until ≥70% germinated). Begin half-strength liquid feed weekly once first true leaves appear. – Capsicum (peppers): check for 2–3 true leaves; pot-up when roots show at drainage holes or growth slows. Target 20–26°C days / ≥15°C nights. Begin half-strength feed weekly after pot-up. Start hardening off at 4–5 true leaves on calm, mild days. – Eggplant: check for sturdy stems and 3–4 true leaves; pot-up as needed. Target 22–28°C days / ≥16°C nights. Begin half-strength feed weekly after pot-up. Start hardening off once nights consistently ≥14–15°C. – Cucumber (Lebanese): soil is ≥18°C — direct sow now; expect germination in ~5–7 days; keep evenly moist. – Chilli: in dome + heat mat now (25–28°C ideal). Germination 10–21 days. Keep evenly moist; vent dome once ≥70% up. Begin weekly half-strength feed after first true leaves. – Passionfruit: in dome + heat mat (20–30°C). Soak 24 h before sowing if possible; germination 2–6 weeks. Pot-up gently; add mycorrhizae at pot-up, not in seed mix. • Blueberry: keep mulch acidic and moist; monthly acidic liquid feed Sep–Mar; chelated iron only if new leaves yellow with green veins. • Citrus: plan seasonal feeds (spring full feed; mid-summer light; autumn potash). Only feed into moist soil. • General: avoid feeding/spraying on very windy or >32°C days.

PM (7:00): • Cutworm patrol (broccoli/peas): night check and handpick. If activity continues, spray Dipel late afternoon once per week; if larvae persist at soil line, do an Eco-Neem drench at the base (no collars). • Eco-oil (citrus): last sprayed 2025-09-06. Do not re-spray before 2025-09-13. From 13–16 Sep, pick the calmest, dry evening (avoid heat/wind) and re-assess pests; only re-apply if needed. If >10 mm rain fell within 24 h of last spray, reset the 7–10 day clock from that date. • Compost: quick sniff/moisture check; if too wet add browns, if too dry add water; turn on your scheduled day and log the date.

Weekly notes: • Roots (carrot/beet): avoid high N; if pale, side-dress very lightly with low N, higher K and water in. • Carrots/Beets harvest readiness: from now, test-pull one every 1–2 weeks; look for shoulders at soil line ~2–3 cm across, good colour, and crisp snap. If small, re-mulch lightly and leave 1–2 weeks. • Carrots/Beets test-pull log: every fortnight on Sunday, pull and record one carrot or beet to track maturity and size. • Sweet potatoes (bags): monthly light organic feed; add sulphate of potash once bulking starts; keep evenly moist. • Tomatoes transplant tip: bury leggy seedlings up to the first leaves for stronger stems and roots. • Shopping list check: review supplies every Sunday (eco-oil, Dipel, Eco-Neem, copper, sulphur, iron chelate, acidic fertiliser, stakes/ties, seed-raising mix) and add refills. • Seed storage (weekly): ensure leftover packets are dry and sealed in an airtight jar with desiccant; store in the fridge; keep out of light. • Only feed/spray when foliage is dry and conditions are calm; always water before and after granular feeds."

After purchase, say “add to shopping list” or tell me when you sow.",,,
2025-09-09,Module — Lettuce (cut-and-come-again),"• Harvest **outer leaves** first; leave central crown intact.
• Take **3–5 leaves/plant** at a time; avoid stripping the plant.
• Cut 2–3 cm above the crown if bulk cutting; don’t damage the growing point.
• Keep **even moisture**; shallow roots dislike dry-down.
• Light feed (seaweed/fish/Charlie Carp) **every 2 weeks**.
• Harvest **in the morning** for crisp leaves.
• Heat plan: provide shade cloth on days **>28 °C**; bitter/bolting risk rises with heat.
• Watch for **bolting** (central stem elongates) — harvest the head soon if seen.",,,
